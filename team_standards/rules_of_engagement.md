#Rules of Engagement

## Communication
- All major architectural decisions are discussed with the dev team.
- Changes in expectations (commitments / blockers etc) are communicated to the team. 
- Expectations of team members are clearly communicated to each other.   
- Context on the state of the work are shared regular with the team to prevent key-man dependencies.
- Issue tracking is kept updated to provide a formal view of the progress of the work. 
- Failures in meeting communication standards are at the very least communicated informally (whatsapp / signal).

## Conflict Resolution
- All communication regarding disputes and disagreements are conveyed in a respectful way. 
- Matters that end in a stalemate are decided by democratic vote by the team. 
- Personal conflicts are kept outside of team communications and discussions.
- As a team we prioritise the wellbeing of the team members over the work (this is not a paid activity).
